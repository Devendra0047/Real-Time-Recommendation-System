Real-Time Recommendation System
Welcome to the Real-Time Recommendation System project. This repository contains code and resources for building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques.

Project Overview
In this project, I have implemented a real-time recommendation system that leverages collaborative filtering to provide personalized product recommendations. The system is built using Python and various data science libraries, and it can be served through a Flask web server.

Data Collection and Processing
I started by collecting interaction data from the Amazon Electronics Rating Dataset. The data was then processed as follows:

Loaded the interaction data using Pandas.
Encoded user and item IDs to ensure they are in a suitable format for model training.
Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Training
To train the recommendation model, I used the Surprise library, which is a popular Python library for building and analyzing recommender systems. The following steps were taken:

Trained an SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) based collaborative filtering model.
Evaluated the model using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure its performance.
Serving Recommendations
The recommendation system is served through a Flask web server. The server provides an endpoint /recommendation to get user-specific recommendations. Here are the key steps involved:

The server generates recommendations by predicting interactions for all items.
It then sorts the items based on the predicted interactions to provide personalized recommendations to the user.
How to Use
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Surprise
Flask
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Devendra0047/Real-Time-Recommendation-System.git
cd Real-Time-Recommendation-System
Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project
To train the model and generate recommendations, run the Jupyter Notebook Real-Time Recommendation System.ipynb.

To start the Flask web server, run:

bash
python app.py
Access the recommendation endpoint by navigating to http://localhost:5000/recommendation in your web browser.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. It highlights the process of data collection, model training, and serving recommendations through a web server.
